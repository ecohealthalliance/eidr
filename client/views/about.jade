          p.lead EIDR is a centralized web-platform dedicated to unraveling the origins of Emerging Infectious Disease (EID) events. Through EIDR, multiple EID events can be compared simultaneously, historical disease emergence can be visualized spatially, and individual emergence events can be explored in depth. This project builds upon previous work at EcoHealth Alliance, like the ‘hotspots’ map published by Jones et al., in 2008 in the journal Nature (Jones et al 2008).

      p.lead Emergence events can be sorted, compared, and investigated in a variety of ways.

          h3 Emergence Events
          p You can explore emergence events using an interactive table of EID events found in the ‘Emergence Events’ view. The information displayed in this table is customizable, allowing you to choose which EIDR variables you want to view. You can perform specific searches within the table using a filter feature. You may want to search for events with a common variable like a specific host, or pathogen.

          h3 Event Pages 
          p You can explore individual EID events in greater detail through individual event pages. These event pages can be accessed from the ‘Emergence Events’ list by clicking an event in the table. Each EID event page contains a detailed report on the event, including a map showing the location of the event, a narrative abstract, and additional information on the event. References used for each event are also available in each event page.

        h3 EID Event Collection
        p For the purpose of EIDR, an EID event is defined as the original case or cluster of cases representing the emergence of an infectious disease in human populations.  Emergence is defined as the development of any of the following with respect to a given microorganism: 
        ol
          li earliest instance of natural human infection
          li reappearance after control or elimination
          li novel drug resistance
          li new or expanded geographic region
          li increased incidence
          li increased virulence

        p Events are not counted amongst EID events unless some clinical significance and relevance is attributable to the pathogen in question. Potential EID events were evaluated based on these definitions by experts at EcoHealth Alliance and classified as EID events if they met any of the above criteria. Events that could not be verified, because of a lack of reliable information, are retained as #[em potential] EID events. An adjoining request for more information is included with these events. See EIDR metadata for more information on these variables.

        p The events in EIDR date back 1940, a cut-off chosen by Jones et al. (Jones et al. 2008), and informed by the Institute of Medicine’s resources on EIDs (Smolinski, Hamburg, and Lederberg 2003). Potential EID events were collected from a review of meta-analyses on disease emergence, or through an internal literature review. All events between 1940 and 2004 derive from Jones et al. (Jones et al. 2008), which relied heavily on the review by Taylor and colleagues (Taylor, Latham, and Woolhouse 2001). Events between 2004 and 2013 derive from a recent effort to map emerging zoonoses (Grace et al. 2012), a review of trends in viral discovery (Rosenberg et al. 2013), or were compiled through a review of the literature.

      .method
        h3 Data Collection and Review
        p For each EID event data were collected on a set of variables determined by a team of EcoHealth Alliance experts. These variables are designed to capture critical spatial, temporal, clinical, epidemiologic, economic, pathogen, host, and zoonotic information. Data were also collected on potential drivers associated with each EID event, like war and famine, antimicrobial agent use, or proximity to wildlife. Driver categories are based on those found in Smolinski et al. (Smolinski, Hamburg, and Lederberg 2003) and Leder et al. (Lederberg, Shope, and Oaks 1992), but some categories are removed and others are broken down further. Emergence locations are resolved to the most specific spatial information available, frequently a polygon representing the smallest administrative region associated with an event. Rarely, multiple potential emergence locations are provided for a single event due to temporal ambiguities within the available literature. Events were independently reviewed at least twice by EcoHealth Alliance veterinarians, disease ecologists, epidemiologists, and public health specialists. A list of all variables and their sub-categories can be found in the Supplementary Information.

        p Short abstracts are included for all events. When possible, direct language from text was captured to justify values for subjective variables. If no information could be found on a particular variable this absence was captured. General contextual information for each event was acquired from various sources, many unrelated to EID events. For example, taxonomic information is from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI 2015), and economic information is from the World Bank (World Bank Group 2015).
