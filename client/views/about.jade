          p.lead A user-friendly and interactive website describing novel emerging infectious disease events between 1940 and 2013.

          p.lead EIDR is a centralized web-platform dedicated to unraveling the origins of Emerging Infectious Disease (EID) events. Through EIDR, multiple EID events can be compared simultaneously, historical disease emergence can be visualized spatially, and individual emergence events can be explored in depth. This project builds upon previous work at EcoHealth Alliance, like the ‘hotspots’ map published by Jones et al., in 2008 in the journal Nature (Jones et al 2008).

      .row
        .col-lg-10
          p.lead Studying the origins of EIDs is a complex task. The term itself is not easily defined. In EIDR, events are considered emerging if they satisfy any of the following characteristics: 
          ol
            li Expanded geographic region or host range
            li Increased incidence or virulence
            li Novel drug resistance
            li Evolution of an existing organism
            li Reappearance after control or elimination
        
          p.lead The developers of EIDR hope this web application will allow users to reflect on what definition(s) of emergence may be the most useful.

      h2 How can you explore disease emergence using EIDR?
      p.lead Emergence events can be sorted, compared, and investigated in a variety of ways.

          h3 Emergence Events
          p You can explore emergence events using an interactive table of EID events found in the ‘Emergence Events’ view. The information displayed in this table is customizable, allowing you to choose which EIDR variables you want to view. You can perform specific searches within the table using a filter feature. You may want to search for events with a common variable like a specific host, or pathogen.

          p You can explore individual EID events in greater detail through individual event pages. These event pages can be accessed from the ‘Emergence Events’ list by clicking an event in the table. Each EID event page contains a detailed report on the event, including a map showing the location of the event, a narrative abstract, and additional information on the event. References used for each event are also available in each event page.
