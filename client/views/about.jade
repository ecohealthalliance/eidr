      h1 EIDR (Emerging Infectious Disease Repository) 
      p.short-desc A user-friendly and interactive website describing novel emerging infectious disease events between 1940 and 2013.
      .row

          p.lead The goal of EIDR is to unravel the origins of Emerging Infectious Disease (EID) events by providing a thorough, transparent, and reviewed investigation of the literature. The project builds upon previous work at EcoHealth Alliance, such as the Hotspots maps published by Jones et al. (2008) in the journal Nature. 
          p.lead EIDR will improve, and expand the data required by the global health community to model disease emergence. Information was extracted directly from the literature and is displayed in maps, tables, and short narratives.

    h2 What is an EID event?
    .row
      .col-lg-10
        p.lead Studying the origins of EIDs is a complex task. The term itself is not easily defined. In EIDR, events are considered emerging if they satisfy any of the following characteristics: 
        ol
          li Expanded geographic region or host range,
          li Increased incidence or virulence, 
          li Novel drug resistance, 
          li Evolution of an existing organism
          li Reappearance after control or elimination. 
          li The developers of EIDR hope this web application will allow users to reflect on what definition(s) of emergence may be the most useful.

      h2 How can you explore disease emergence using EIDR?
      p.lead Emergence events can be sorted, compared, and investigated in a variety of ways.

          h3 Emergence Events
          p You can explore emergence events using an interactive table of EID events found in the ‘Emergence Events’ view. The information displayed in this table is customizable, allowing you to choose which EIDR variables you want to view. You can perform specific searches within the table using a filter feature. You may want to search for events with a common variable, like a specific host, or pathogen.

          p You can explore individual EID events in greater detail through individual event pages. These event pages can be accessed from the ‘Emergence Events’ list by clicking an event in the table. Each EID event page contains a detailed report on the event, including a map showing the location of the event, a narrative abstract, and additional information on the event. References used for each event are also available in each event page.
